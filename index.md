### CPSC 120

* Lab 6 Part 2

    Lab 6 Guessing Game Part 2: I enjoyed Part 2 of Lab 6 because it was interesting to program a guessing game by having Player 1 input a number into the terminal when we run the program, then having player 2 guess it, and afterward giving player 2 hints on if they are warmer or colder to the actual number guessed. 


* Lab 7 Part 1

    Lab 7 Part 1 Calculating Days between two dates: I enjoyed Part 1 of Lab 7 because it was something that can actually be useful in calculating the number of days that two separate dates may have. It was a headache to get the correct days, but after trial and error, my partners and I were able to code it properly and see that the fruits of our labor paid off.


* Lab 8 Part 3

   Lab 8 Part 3 ASCII/ ANSI Art Animation: I enjoyed Part 3 of Lab 8 because it was programming the already existing ASCII/ ANSI Art files to our code and seeing the animation being created in real-time, with each frame having more text than the previous. This was also during the week of Halloween, so we were able to get in the mood for the spookiest day of the year with the pumpkin animation.
